# scc-maintence-in-incremental-graphs
Implementation of relevant algorithms to the maintenance of strong components in incremental graphs

Currently has:
- implementation of a naive algorithm (`scc_union_find.py`)
- (under work) implementation of the topological search algorithm as per [Haeupler et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2071379.2071382).
