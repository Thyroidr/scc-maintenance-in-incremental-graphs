# scc-maintence-in-incremental-graphs
Implementation of relevant algorithms to the maintenance of strong components in incremental graphs

Currently has:
- Implementation of a naive algorithm (`scc_union_find.py`)
- Implementation of the topological search algorithm as per [Haeupler et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2071379.2071382).

Both implementations above pass the tests in `test/test_scc_maintainer.py` (as of 09/02/2022)
